<h2><strong>Death Rate Prediction by Cardiovascular Disease using Heart failure data from kaggle</strong></h2>
[Final_project_sameena_mujawar-checkpoint.ipynb](Final_project_sameena_mujawar-checkpoint.ipynb)
<ul>
  <li>To develop a predictive model that can accurately identify the likelihood of heart failure-related deaths based on a set of clinical and demographic features. The primary aim is to improve early intervention and patient care by leveraging machine learning techniques to predict adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure.
<li>
  <li><strong>Technology & Tools Used:</strong> R, R-Jupyter notebook</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Learning Models:</strong> Logistic Regressio, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation Parameter:</strong> P-value,F1 Score, Precision,Recall,Accuracy, confusion matrix.</li>
  <li><strong>Conclusion Based on the metrics:</strong> 
     <ul> <li>Logistic Regression provides a balanced performance with good accuracy and precision with an accuracy of 79.5%. </li>
       <li> Decision Tree CV excels in terms of F1 Score at 84.3%, offering a well-rounded performance.</li>
       <li>Random Forest CV achieves the highest accuracy at 93.6%, and a competitive F1 Score of 93%, making it a strong candidate.</li>
       <li>Support Vector Machine CV provides a good balance between precision and recall.</li>
   <p>Decision Tree CV may be preferred based on higher F1score, while Random Forest CV is a solid choice for high accuracy. Logistic Regression offers simplicity and interpretability, and Support Vector Machine CV gives the balance between precision and recall.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Developed a predictive model to accurately identify the likelihood of heart failure-related deaths based on clinical and demographic features. The aim was to improve early intervention and patient care through machine learning techniques for predicting adverse outcomes in heart failure patients.</li>
    <li><strong>Technology & Tools Used:</strong> R, R-Jupyter Notebook</li>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning Models:</strong> Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation Parameters:</strong> P-value, F1 Score, Precision, Recall, Accuracy, Confusion Matrix</li>
    <li><strong>Conclusions Based on Metrics:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> Achieved a balanced performance with 79.5% accuracy and good precision. It offers simplicity and interpretability, making it a practical choice for initial modeling.</li>
            <li><strong>Decision Tree CV:</strong> Excelled in terms of the F1 Score, reaching 84.3%, providing a well-rounded performance across metrics. This makes it ideal when the F1 Score is the primary focus for imbalanced datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Random Forest CV:</strong> Achieved the highest accuracy at 93.6%, with a competitive F1 Score of 93%. It offers robustness and consistency, making it a strong candidate for the final model selection.</li>
            <li><strong>Support Vector Machine CV:</strong> Provided a good balance between precision and recall, making it a solid model when both metrics are of high importance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, <strong>Decision Tree CV</strong> may be preferred based on the higher F1 Score, while <strong>Random Forest CV</strong> stands out for its superior accuracy. Logistic Regression is a good choice for its simplicity and ease of interpretation, and Support Vector Machine offers a well-balanced performance.</p>
