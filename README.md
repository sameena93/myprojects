<h1>Machine Learning | Deep Learning | Generative AI Projects</h1>
<p>Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository showcases various data science, machine learning, and AI projects Iâ€™ve worked on. Each project demonstrates a different aspect of my skills in data analysis, machine learning, AI models, and data visualization.

<h2><strong>Death Rate Prediction by Cardiovascular Disease using Heart Failure Data from Kaggle</strong></h2>

[View the project notebook](https://github.com/sameena93/multilprojects/blob/Sameena/Final_project_sameena_mujawar-checkpoint.ipynb)

<ul>
  <li>To develop a predictive model that can accurately identify the likelihood of heart failure-related deaths based on a set of clinical and demographic features. The primary aim is to improve early intervention and patient care by leveraging machine learning techniques to predict adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure.</li>
  <li><strong>Technology & Tools Used:</strong> R, R-Jupyter notebook</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Learning Models:</strong> Logistic Regressio, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation Parameter:</strong> P-value,F1 Score, Precision,Recall,Accuracy, confusion matrix.</li>
  <li><strong>Conclusion Based on the metrics:</strong> 
     <ul> <li>Logistic Regression provides a balanced performance with good accuracy and precision with an accuracy of 79.5%. </li>
       <li> Decision Tree CV excels in terms of F1 Score at 84.3%, offering a well-rounded performance.</li>
       <li>Random Forest CV achieves the highest accuracy at 93.6%, and a competitive F1 Score of 93%, making it a strong candidate.</li>
       <li>Support Vector Machine CV provides a good balance between precision and recall.</li>
   <p>Decision Tree CV may be preferred based on higher F1score, while Random Forest CV is a solid choice for high accuracy. Logistic Regression offers simplicity and interpretability, and Support Vector Machine CV gives the balance between precision and recall.</p></ul></ul>

<p>This project is a Pizza Ordering System that allows users to select the size of a pizza, customize it with toppings, and calculate the final cost of the order. The system is designed to be interactive and user-friendly, giving users options to modify their selections (both pizza size and toppings) and displaying the total cost of their order.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tools: Python OOP Approach, Text file Handling like read write, External Libraries for UI formatting</li>
    <li>This project demonstrates how to build a menu-driven, interactive console application for a pizza ordering system with Python. The focus is on order management, pricing calculations, user-friendly interaction, and basic persistence using text files.
</li>
</ul>
