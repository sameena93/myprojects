<h2>Death Rate Prediction by Cardiovascular Disease using Heart failure data from kaggle</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To develop a predictive model that can accurately identify the likelihood of heart failure-related deaths based on a set of clinical and demographic features. The primary aim is to improve early intervention and patient care by leveraging machine learning techniques to predict adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure.
<li>
  <li>Technology & Tools Used: R, R-Jupyter notebook</li>
  <li>Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regressio, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine</li>
  <li>Evaluation Parameter: P-value,F1 Score, Precision,Recall,Accuracy, confusion matrix.</li>
  <li>Conclusion Based on the metrics: 
     <ul> <li>Logistic Regression provides a balanced performance with good accuracy and precision with an accuracy of 79.5%. </li>
       <li> Decision Tree CV excels in terms of F1 Score at 84.3%, offering a well-rounded performance.</li>
       <li>Random Forest CV achieves the highest accuracy at 93.6%, and a competitive F1 Score of 93%, making it a strong candidate.</li>
       <li>Support Vector Machine CV provides a good balance between precision and recall.</li>
   <p>Decision Tree CV may be preferred based on higher F1score, while Random Forest CV is a solid choice for high accuracy. Logistic Regression offers simplicity and interpretability, and Support Vector Machine CV gives the balance between precision and recall.</p>
